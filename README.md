This is a very rundown version of the code running at http://loadshedding.webredirect.org
It is only necessary to use a token from ESP once a change in the status of Eskom has been detected.
With the problems at Twitter and the changes to the API. I am using alternative means to check for updates.
The database contains all the areas in SA and gets updated as errors and new requests arise.

export your ESP_TOKEN
Clone the repo and run main.py
