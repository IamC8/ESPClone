# ESPClone
## Info
This is a very rundown version of the code running at [Telegram Loadshedding Search](http://loadshedding.webredirect.org)

The database contains all the areas in SA and gets updated as errors and new requests arise.



### How to use the code
[Subscribe to ESP's API](https://eskomsepush.gumroad.com/l/api) and get a token.

In your terminal please set your environment variables by running the following lines of code.
> export 'ESP_TOKEN'='<esp_token>'

Run main.py

Have a look at the code. You'll see an example of a search.
The data you get back is in the format of the API of ESP, but you can change it very easily.

You'll only use a **single token from ESP** once a change in the status of Eskom has been detected.


With the problems at Twitter and the changes to their API policies, I am using alternative means to check for updates.
